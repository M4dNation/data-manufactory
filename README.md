## About

`data-manufactory` is a package for creating batch of objects.
It provides a simple factory class you can instanciate to generate the batches you need.

**Note: This package is based on `meteor-factory` written by [versolearning](https://github.com/versolearning).  
Most of the credits goes to them.  
If you don't need our trimmed version of the package, please use the original one.**

## Install

`npm install --save data-manufactory`  
`yarn add data-manufactory`

## Usage

`data-manufactory` exports a single `Factory` class you can import :

```javascript
// ES6
import Factory from "data-manufactory";

// ES5
const Factory = require("data-manufactory");
```

Once imported, you just have to instanciate it to have an exportable factory you can use to generate data.

```javascript
import Factory from "data-manufactory";

// In order to differentiate your factories, we advise you to name them as the data being generated
export const DataFactory = new Factory({
  name: "factory", // The name of your factory
  schema: {}, // The schema to apply and generate the data
  after: [], // An array of function to apply each time an object is generated during build
  afterBuild: [], // An array of function to apply after the build is completed
  enableLogging: false, // Whether or not the logging should be enabled for this seeder
});
```

### Contributing to the package

We try to keep `data-manufactory` as simple as possible, this is why we decided to clone the package created by [versolearning](https://github.com/versolearning).
